DBH_timeframe,"Identifies whether the measurement occurs pre-treatment (""Pre"") or post-treatment (""Post"")",string,NA
Treatment,Name of treatment; Burn = prescribed burn; Thin = mechanical thining; Burn+Thin = both prescribed burn and mechancial thin; Control = control.,string,NA
PFT,"Plant functional type; includes cedar, fir, oak, and pine, and possibly others depending on the site",string,NA
PFT_fraction,Average fraction (by basal area) of trees of the given PFT with DBH >= 15cm in treated units during the final year of measurement.,float,NA
SE_PFT_fraction,Standard error of average PFT fraction in the final year of measurement.,float,NA
Final_yr_pct_diff,Average percent difference between treatment unit and control unit PFT fraction in the final year of measurement.,float,%
