DBH_timeframe,"Identifies whether the measurement occurs pre-treatment (""Pre"") or post-treatment (""Post"").",string,NA
PrePost,"Average fraction (by basal area) of trees of the given PFT with DBH >= 15cm. For pre-treatment measurements, this value is taken from a single point in time. For post-treatment, this is a weighted average, in which the mean value during each measurement interval is weighted by the number of years in the measurement interval.",float,NA
