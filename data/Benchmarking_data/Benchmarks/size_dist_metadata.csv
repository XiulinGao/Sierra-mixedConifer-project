Avg,"Average stems per hectare of trees with DBH >= 15cm over the entire post-treatment time period. This is a weighted average, in which the mean stems per hectare during each measurement interval is weighted by the number of years in the measurement interval.",float,stems/ha

Avg_pct_diff,"Average percent difference between treatment unit and control unit stems per hectare across all post-treatment measurements. This is a weighted average, in which differences during each measurement interval are weighted by the number of years in the measurement interval.
NB: For Blodgett and STEF, this value is calculated as the weighted average of the differences across measurement periods. For Teakettle, it should be the difference of the weighted average calculated over the post-treatment study period.",float,%
