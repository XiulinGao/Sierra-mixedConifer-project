DBH_timeframe,"Identifies whether the measurement occurs pre-treatment (""Pre"") or post-treatment (""Post"").",string,NA
PrePost,"Average number of trees per hectare of the given size class (see Size_class definition for minimum bounds). For pre-treatment measurements, this value is taken from a single point in time. For post-treatment, this is a weighted average, in which the mean value during each measurement interval is weighted by the number of years in the measurement interval.",float,stems/ha
SE_PrePost,"Standard error of the value in the ""PrePost"" column.",float,stems/ha
PrePost_lower.CL,"Lower bound of 95% confidence interval of the value in the ""PrePost"" column.",float,stems/ha
PrePost_upper.CL,"Upper bound of 95% confidence interval of the value in the ""PrePost"" column. ",float,stems/ha

Size_class,"The upper bound of each size class bin. For all sites and treatments , size class bins are as follows: 15-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, 90-100, and >100. The final size bin will have a label corresponding to the DBH of the largest tree at the site. ",string,cm
