DBH_timeframe,"Identifies whether the measurement occurs pre-treatment (""Pre"") or post-treatment (""Post"").",string,NA
PrePost,"Average number of trees per hectare of the given size class with DBH >= 15cm. For pre-treatment measurements, this value is taken from a single point in time. For post-treatment, this is a weighted average, in which the mean value during each measurement interval is weighted by the number of years in the measurement interval.",float,stems/ha
SE_PrePost,"Standard error of the value in the ""PrePost"" column.",float,stems/ha
PrePost_lower.CL,"Lower bound of 95% confidence interval of the value in the ""PrePost"" column.",float,stems/ha
PrePost_upper.CL,"Upper bound of 95% confidence interval of the value in the ""PrePost"" column.",float,stems/ha
PrePost_pct_diff,Average percent difference between the pre-treatment and post-treatment estimates. ,float,%
SE_PrePost_pct_diff,Standard error of average percent difference between pre- and post-treatment measurements.,float,%
Treatment,Name of treatment; Burn = prescribed burn; Thin = mechanical thining; Burn+Thin = both prescribed burn and mechancial thin; Control = control.,string,NA
Size_class,"The upper bound of each size class bin. Size class bins are as follows: 15-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, 90-100, and >100. The final size bin will have a label corresponding to the DBH of the largest tree at the site.",string,cm
