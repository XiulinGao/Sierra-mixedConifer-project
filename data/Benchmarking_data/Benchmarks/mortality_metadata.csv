Treatment,Name of treatment; Burn = prescribed burn; Thin = mechanical thining; Burn+Thin = both prescribed burn and mechancial thin; Control = control.,string,NA
prob,Probability of mortality of trees >= 15cm DBH during the given calculation interval. This is not an annualized mortality; it is the total mortality for the number of years given in the calculation interval. ,float,NA
SE,Standard error of probability of mortality over calculation interval,float,NA
annual_mortality,Annualized (per year) mortality rate of trees >= 15cm during the calculation interval.,float,NA
SE_annual,Standard error of the annualized probability of mortality.,float,NA
lower95CL,Lower bound of 95% confidence interval of annualized mortality,float,NA
upper95CL,Lower bound of 95% confidence interval of annualized mortality,float,NA
PFT,"Plant functional type; includes cedar, fir, pine, and oak",string,NA
calculationInterval,Period of time (and number of years covered by that period) over which mortality is calculated,string,NA
diff,"Difference between mortality in the Treatment relative to mortality in the Control. This is a simple difference, not a percent difference.",float,NA
se_diff,Standard error of the difference between Treatment and Control mortality,float,NA
lower95_diff,Lower bound of 95% confidence interval of difference between Treatment and Control mortality,float,NA
upper95_diff,Upper bound of 95% confidence interval of difference between Treatment and Control mortality,float,NA
